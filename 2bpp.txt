==Loading an 8x8 gb tile (2bpp)==
Each 8x8 tile has 16 bytes
Each row has 2 bytes (16 bits)
Convert the bytes to binary (FF = 11111111)
The 2nd set of bits (second bitplane) goes on top.

Example: In a hex editor, you see AA BB. You'd read it in binary as:
bbbbbbbb
aaaaaaaa

You'll have a palette (4 index)
palette[0] = color1
palette[1] = color2
palette[2] = color3
palette[3] = color4

Combine the above values vertically
ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

When converting the binary values back into decimal, you'll have your palette index in binary.
Example
00101100
11110110

01 01 11 01 10 11 01 00

FINAL: 01 01 03 01 02 03 01 00

Repeat until a full 8x8 tile is assembled.
